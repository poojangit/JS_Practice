----------------SYNCHRONOUS-----------------

1. Tasks are executed one after another
2. Blocking of the code . because some tasks does not complete on time
3. These are executed slower.
4. useful in some simple codes 

----------------ASYNCHRONOUS-----------------

1. Tasks are executed independently
2. Non-blocking of the code due to its independent execution
3. These executes faster.
4. Usefull in API calls , fetching data, setTimeout etc.
5. event loop : 
    JavaScript uses a mechannism called event loop to handle the asynchrous task .
6. Aynchronous techniques :
   a. callBacks
   b. promises
   c. Async and Await

a. callBacks : callbacks are the functions that is passed as an argument to another function

b. promises : promises is an object that represents eventual completion or failure of an asynchrous op

c. async/Await : it simplifies working with promises.and makes sure asynchronous code to be written like syncronous.
