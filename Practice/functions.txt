---------------------FUNCTIONS------------------------

1. Functions are the reuable blocks of the code. They are used to perform some specific tasks.
2. Types of Functions :
   a. Named Functions
   b. Function expression
   c. Immediately invoked function expression(IIFE)
   d. Higher Order function(HOI)
   e. CallBack Function
   f. arrow functions.
   g. annonymous functions
   h. Async functions

3. Named Functions:
   a. These functions will have the names.
   b. it is usefull as the function will have the name and easy to call the function by its name

4. Function expressions : 
    a function is defined and assigned to a variable.
    b. it is usefull when passing the functions as arguments or assigning them to the variables

5. IIFE : 
    a. These ate function that immediately invoked after the function is defined.
    b. It is usefull for encapsulated variables and avoids polluting the global scope.

6. HOI Functions:
    a. thses functions takes annother function as an arguments and return functions.
    b. these enables functional programming concepts like map, filter and reduce. 

7. CallBack functions:
    a. these functions are passed as an agrument to another Function
    b. these are mainly used in asynchronous Operations

8. Arrow functions: 
    a. These are the concise way for function expression.
    b. useful in simplifing the function expression and CallBack function

9. annonymous functions :
    a. these are the functions without the names
    b. these are useful for one-time use.

10. Async functions:
    a. functions that handle aysnchrous code more easily using async and await
    b. used in promises and asynchronous works.
